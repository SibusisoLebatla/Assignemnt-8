Challenges:

Choosing the right granularity was difficult — too much detail reduced clarity; too little omitted logic.

Mapping to Agile stories required reviewing each story’s intent to ensure diagram alignment.

Comparison:

State Diagrams: Best for modeling how objects behave in the system lifecycle (e.g., Book becomes Reserved).

Activity Diagrams: Best for illustrating how processes and users interact step-by-step (e.g., Checkout Process).
